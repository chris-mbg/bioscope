# Bioscope movies :film_strip:

An application created as part of my education to be a frontend developer :woman_technologist:

### Technologies used
* React Hooks
* React Router
* React Query
* React Bootstrap and Bootstrap

### General info
The assignment (given in the course *JavaScript - advanced*) was to create an application where a user can browse for movies, both by showing list of genre specific movies and also list of ie trending movies. The user can then choose to read more about a movie and the participating actors. The application also has functionality to search for a movie.

All the data is retrieved from the API of The Movie Database (TMDB) and to facilitate the data fetching React Query is implemented.
